Ecomtips is a platform dedicated to helping all entrepeneurs old and young optimize their E-commerce ventures to their maximum capacity, in addition with providing general advice about online money making.

I have been making money online consistently throughout my senior schooling, starting at the ripe age of 16 with $100 to my name. Today I have expanded this wealth to a copious amount, which could give me the opportunity to live off my own ventures and be financially free. My mission here at Ecomtips is to provide all people, from novices to experts with an opportunity to have hope of an alternate lifestyle to which they are destined to have/currently have.

*So why this website?*
I'm going to be honest here. Most content on the internet available right now to educate people on the E-commerce ventures such as dropshipping and Amazon FBA are watered down to the highest degree, fooling those just starting out to buy an overpriced course that provides as much information that a singular subreddit provides. This is why it is my job to provide this platform, to save others from wasting their time watching Youtube videos with unvaluable and misleading information.

*For the experts in the room*
You have also come to the right place. I will provide all tips on key information in regards to marketing,finance and economics I have gathered from my own ventures, in addition with studying the latest case studies in regards to E-commerce and other online ventures such as digital/affiliate marketing, Amazon FBA and freelancing. 
As an extra benefit, I will link all programs and software I have used in every blog post, to make the transition from following my advice to putting it into practice a lot easier!
